We have developed in-house code using FORTRAN 90 to conduct classical molecular dynamics
simulations. This code utilizes a rigid body mechanism implemented through quaternion algorithms.
We have also designed a specialized force field specifically for both rigid and flexible water
monomers, incorporating explicit 2-body, 3-body, and N-body induction components.
